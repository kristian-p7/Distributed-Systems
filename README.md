# Distributed-Systems
The aim of the project is to develop a distributed system for monitoring ocean wave height. This system represents a significant leap in maritime technology, focusing on a decentralized, resilient and scalable approach that seamlessly adapts to the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the ocean. At the heart of the project is a peer-to-peer architecture, a structure carefully chosen for its robustness and adaptability. Unlike traditional centralized models, this system uses multiple wave sensors. These sensors can be dynamically added or removed, providing unparalleled flexibility and respon-siveness to changing ocean conditions. This feature is particularly important for real-time monitoring, ensuring that the system is not only operational but also highly ef-fective with as few as three active sensors. The innovative spirit of the project is fur-

ther exemplified by its fault-tolerance capabilities. Ocean monitoring poses signifi-cant challenges due to the harsh and unpredictable marine environment. The system's fault tolerance ensures uninterrupted functionality, a critical factor in scenarios where reliable data is essential for timely decision making. One of the most notable innova-tions of this project is the implementation of a voting mechanism to select a leader sensor. This mechanism is at the heart of the decentralized decision-making process. The leader-sensor, once elected, takes on a central role. It is responsible for compiling and calculating average wave heights from the data collected by the network of sen-sors.

The information gathered by these sensors is highly valuable, contributing significant-ly to our understanding of the marine environment and helping to formulate effective maritime policies and strategies. By harnessing the power of peer-to-peer architec-tures and innovative sensor technology, this project stands as a beacon of progress in our ongoing endeavor to understand and protect our marine ecosystems.
